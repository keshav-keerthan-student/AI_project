# Simple Chatbot — Assignment

A tiny single-page rule-based chatbot built with HTML/CSS/JS.  
Works offline (client-side). Quick to push to GitHub and host via GitHub Pages.

## How to run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser, or use a Live Server extension.

## How to host on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub.
2. Push these files to the repo (instructions below).
3. In repo **Settings → Pages**, select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, save.  
   The site will be at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Notes
- This is intentionally minimal for a quick assignment demonstration.
- To integrate an API (OpenAI or other), add a backend to keep keys secret.
